# Blockquotes

For quoting blocks of content from another source within your document. Wrap `<blockquote class="blockquote">` around any HTML as the quote.

<Canvas>
<blockquote className="blockquote">
  <p>A well-known quote, contained in a blockquote element.</p>
</blockquote>
</Canvas>

## Naming a source

The HTML spec requires that blockquote attribution be placed outside the `<blockquote>`. When providing attribution, wrap your `<blockquote>` in a `<figure>` and use a `<figcaption>` or a block level element (e.g., `<p>`) with the `.blockquote-footer` class. Be sure to wrap the name of the source work in `<cite>` as well.

<Canvas>
<figure>
  <blockquote className="blockquote">
    <p>A well-known quote, contained in a blockquote element.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <figcaption className="blockquote-footer">
    Someone famous in <cite title="Source Title">Source Title</cite>
  </figcaption>
</figure>
</Canvas>
